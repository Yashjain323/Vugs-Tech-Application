# Vugs-Tech-Application
The collaborator should go through the following before starting to go ahead in the progress of the project :
1. The application is almost complete if frontend is concerned.
   Though the collaborator can devleop more as per the requirements of the mentor or with his/her understanding.
2. The part that makes the app incomplete is that of backend or more specifically database configuration.
   The app is somewhat not able to contact the database or have some small errors in that.
3. The collaborator should some take into conern the loopholes or the obstructions that have led to stoppin of application at some instances.
